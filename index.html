                <article>
                    <p>Use of the API requires API Authentication Credentials. As well, the associated admin user must have 
                        the API Access permission granted to their admin role group.</p>
                    <p>API Authentication Credentials can be generated for an admin user within the Admin area as described 
                        in the WHMCS Documentation.</p>
                    <p>Authentication is required for each API request.</p>
                    <h3>Authenticating With API Credentials</h3>
                    <p>API requests will be authenticated based on the request parameters identifier and secret as 
                        provisioned when Creating Admin API Authentication Credentials within the WHMCS Admin Area.</p>
                        <code>
                            $api_identifier = 'D4j1dKYE3g40VROOPCGyJ9zRwP0ADJIv';
$api_secret = 'F1CKGXRIpylMfsrig3mwwdSdYUdLiFlo';

$postfields = array(
'identifier' => $api_identifier,
'secret' => $api_secret,
'action' => $api_call,
'responsetype' => $response_type,
);
                        </code>
                    <p>For forwards compatibility with existing integrations, the identifier and secret may also be passed 
                        in the username and password fields respectively. A valid identifier and secret combination passed 
                        in this way will also result in successful authentication.</p>
                    <h3>Authenticating With Login Credentials</h3>
                    <p>Prior to WHMCS verison 7.2, authentication was validated based on admin login credentials, and not API 
                        Authentication Credentials. This method of authentication is still supported for backwards compatibility 
                        but may be deprecated in a future version of WHMCS.</p>
                    <p>To authenticate with the admin login credentials, pass the admin username and the MD5 hashed value of the 
                        respective adminâ€™s password.</p>
                        <code>$username = "your_admin_login_username";
                            $password = "your_admin_login_password";
                            
                            $postfields = array(
                                'username' => $username,
                                'password' => md5($password),
                                'action' => $api_call,
                                'responsetype' => $response_type,
                            );
